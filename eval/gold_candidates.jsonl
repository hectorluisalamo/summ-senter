The plan began in April 2024 after a tip revealed Maduro's jets were undergoing repairs in the Dominican Republic. The agent, Edwin Lopez, met the pilots in an airport hangar, ultimately pitching Villegas a lucrative deal to fly Maduro to a location where U.S. authorities could seize him. Even after retiring in July 2025, Lopez continued contacting Villegas through encrypted apps, including messages referencing the U.S. bounty on Maduro — raised to $50 million after Trump returned to the White House and escalated operations against Venezuela, including CIA covert actions and military strikes on suspected drug smugglers.
