The Chamber, whose Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said the charge “will make it cost-prohibitive” for employers, argues the fee—instituted by an executive order last month for new H-1B requests and paired with a “gold card” fast-track option with fees starting at about £1m—will harm hiring in the US tech sector; the White House called the step lawful and necessary. The court challenge will test the administration's authority to impose the levy and could shape how major firms and startups recruit overseas talent."}

Singh, an Indian passport holder who has lived in the US since 1994 and lives in Indiana with his wife and two US-citizen children whose family owns gas stations, was detained on 30 July while returning from India and faces deportation after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement cited two-decade-old cases. His family and lawyer Louis Angeles say there are no active cases, that Singh — who has a brain tumour and a heart condition — is not receiving adequate treatment and is only getting check-ups, and they are seeking his release or proper medical care while his case remains unresolved."}

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to order the US Department of Agriculture to tap emergency reserves to distribute benefits to nearly 42 million people who rely on SNAP after the USDA said no benefits would be issued on Nov. 1. Democratic attorneys general and three governors say the government is legally required to maintain benefits and have asked for a ruling by Friday. SNAP serves roughly one in eight low-income Americans at about 8 billion per month while the USDA contingency fund is estimated at about 6 billion, and the program's potential expiration has become a major point in the shutdown standoff."}

Auzière, 41 and the step-daughter of French President Emmanuel Macron, testified on the second and final day of the trial of 10 people accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims about Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality, saying the 72-year-old has long been the target of conspiracy theories alleging she is transgender. She said her mother's life 'deteriorated' since the attacks, that abuses were reported to her daily, and that Brigitte Macron has had to be careful about outfit choices and posture because her image is used to fuel the rumours."}

A unanimous jury convicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records after prosecutors said he instructed his lawyer Michael Cohen to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000 before the 2016 election and then reimbursed Cohen through fraudulent entries; in December a judge, citing Trump's imminent return to the White House, imposed an unconditional discharge. The spring 2024 trial unfolded during Trump's re-election campaign, with prosecutors saying the disguised payments amounted to election interference. The Manhattan District Attorney's office has not immediately commented on the latest filing."}

Duffy told Fox News he was “about to pull $160m” and said the department could also strip California's authority to issue CDLs; the Transportation Department tightened rules after three fatal crashes blamed on immigrant truck drivers, announcing emergency regulations on Sept. 26 that took effect Sept. 29, limiting CDLs for non-citizens to three visa classes and requiring federal immigration checks. California DMV spokesperson Eva Spiegel said the state is in compliance and called any withholding of funds illegitimate; if unresolved, Duffy's threat could lead to federal fund cuts or revocation of CDL-issuing authority."}

The party won 13 of 24 Senate seats and 64 of 127 contested lower-house seats, up from seven and 37 respectively, easing Milei's path to slash state spending and deregulate the economy. Former US president Donald Trump publicly congratulated Milei and tied a potential $40bn US lifeline to his political momentum, a move critics described as foreign interference. Opposition lawmakers had overturned his vetoes on university and disability funding before the vote, and hundreds of supporters cheered outside a Buenos Aires hotel as results came in."}

Seven deaths have been attributed to Melissa across the Caribbean before landfall — three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic — and more than 240,000 people in Jamaica were without power while roughly a quarter of the country's telecommunications network was offline. Authorities and emergency crews are expected to assess damage and work to restore power and communications in the coming days, and the National Hurricane Center will continue to monitor the storm and issue updates."}

Provisional results announced by the Independent Electoral Commission on Monday evening show the 83-year-old won a fourth term with 89.77% of the vote, about 3.75 million votes, while runner-up Jean-Louis Billon garnered roughly 3%; Ouattara faced four lesser-known candidates after opposition heavyweights Laurent Gbagbo and Tidjane Thiam were barred from contesting. Barring any surprise from the Constitutional Council during the stipulated five-day challenge period, Ouattara, who has been in office since 2011, is set to lead the world's largest cocoa producer until 2030, a tenure marked by strong growth and infrastructure projects but also accusations of cronyism and repression of opposition."}

The slow-moving hurricane lashed Jamaica with intense winds and heavy rain that caused extensive damage, with reported winds that escalated from 70 mph to 140 mph (225 km/h) in a single day—one of the fastest intensifications on record in the Atlantic—and has since weakened to Category 3 as it lingers over Cuba. Satellite footage captured the storm's eyewall passing over Jamaica, US Air Force aircraft have flown reconnaissance missions through the system, and forecasters say Melissa could still unleash significant destruction as it moves toward the Bahamas."}

Local activists released unverified video showing a fighter known for executing civilians shooting unarmed people at point-blank range and footage showing dozens of bodies and burnt vehicles, while army-allied Joint Forces on Tuesday accused the RSF of executing more than 2,000 unarmed civilians; Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab said open-source and satellite evidence was consistent with systematic ethnic cleansing of Fur, Zaghawa and Berti communities, including alleged door-to-door clearance operations. The footage has not been independently verified, and the Yale lab says it will continue monitoring the situation with satellite imagery and open-source intelligence as investigators and observers seek to corroborate allegations and document potential crimes."}

U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick last week ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep Souvannarath in the United States while he pressed what the judge called his “substantial claim of U.S. citizenship”; court filings say he was born in a Thai refugee camp and received lawful permanent residence before his first birthday, and he told his wife on Sunday via WhatsApp that he was in Dongmakkhai, Laos. Souvannarath had been detained at a newly opened ICE facility at the Louisiana state penitentiary at Angola, and the ACLU of Louisiana, which represents him, called the deportation a “stunning violation of a federal court order”; ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}

The constitutional council said Biya won 53.66% of the vote while his former ally-turned-challenger Issa Tchiroma Bakary received 35.19%; Biya, 92, has been in power since 1982 and removed presidential term limits in 2008. The announcement comes amid tensions: a ban on public gatherings remains in effect, internet restrictions have been reported in the economic capital Douala, and clashes between security forces and opposition supporters left four people dead in Douala and, according to Tchiroma, two killed outside his home in Garoua. The opposition disputes the result and further protests or legal challenges are expected."}

In a note on his Gates Notes website on Monday, the Microsoft co-founder criticized a 'doomsday view of climate change' and said the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, in November should refocus leaders on improving lives; his memo followed a UN warning a day earlier that humanity had missed the 1.5C target, with secretary-general António Guterres warning of 'devastating consequences.' Gates acknowledged climate impacts will hit the poorest hardest but argued they will not cause humanity's demise and said scarce resources should prioritize interventions that reduce poverty and disease, a stance at odds with Guterres' call to recognise failure on limiting warming."}

Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean. The carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, will deploy to the US Southern Command area, and the Pentagon said the additional forces are intended to disrupt narcotics trafficking; the US has also conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the region. President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organisation, which Maduro denies, and many countries do not recognise him after a widely disputed 2024 election; Venezuelans fear the military build-up could be aimed at removing Maduro, while US officials say the deployment is meant to curb drug smuggling."}

The notations—characters and dots above the word “alleluia”—appear on a liturgical Easter text probably created in Germany in the second half of the ninth century, and Raab, president of the Raab Collection, says he spent months researching their origin and significance; earlier Western examples include the Laon Gradual and the St Gall Cantatorium from the late ninth or early tenth centuries. Researchers say the marks indicate pitch inflections as visual aids for singers, and the find will prompt further scholarly study and comparison with other early notation sources."}

Paxton, a Republican, filed the suit a month after President Donald Trump promoted an unproven link between prenatal acetaminophen use and autism, accusing the companies of prioritizing profits; Kenvue countered that there is no credible evidence tying Tylenol to autism and warned against misinformation. Medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say acetaminophen is among the few recommended options for pain and fever in pregnancy and that decades of research have not produced reputable evidence linking prenatal use to neurodevelopmental disorders; the lawsuit will now proceed through the courts as the parties contest the science and public messaging."}
