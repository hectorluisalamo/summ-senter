Reference language: A (English)

How to summarize (3–5 sentences):
- Capture WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE and the main claim(s).
- Include key numbers, dates, locations, quotes, or named sources if central.
- Avoid speculation or adding facts not in the article.
- Be concise but faithful; no flourishes.

Sentiment labeling (about framing/tone):
- positive: favorable/celebratory language about the subject/event.
- neutral: factual, balanced, minimal affect.
- negative: critical/alarmist/disapproving framing.

Edge rules:
- Headlines/lede weigh more than a single quote’s tone.
- Wire copy (Reuters/AP) tends to be neutral—don’t overread.
- If ambiguous → label neutral.

Quality rubric (use later for spot checks; 1–5):
1 = wrong facts or missing core claim
3 = mostly correct, misses secondary detail
5 = faithful, concise, key details present
